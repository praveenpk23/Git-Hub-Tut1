Hello , Im praveenKumar fouder Workfys,Makie.

Proof:

1. 
     A few years back, I fell in love or had some feelings for a classmate girl, and she filled my head. I confessed to 
    her at college but couldn't move on. After some time passed, I decided to quit and focus on myself, my goals, and 
    my purpose. I built a freelancing business and barely did some projects for clients. I built a reputation, gained 
    knowledge on projects and stuff, and now I'm going to start my new startup. Yesterday, she sent me a follow request
    on Instagram.

    Boom!


2.
        I saw some random cute girl (seductive), and one specific girl intentionally avoided looking at me when I crossed 
    or came around. Coincidentally, again, I didn't give a shit. One day, I woke up early and ran 4.5 km at once, 
    setting a personal record. Heading back home around 7:30-8:00 am, she saw me roughly 70 meters before, and when I 
    crossed her, she intentionally stared at me, maybe thinking, 'He's heading home with a sweaty shirt at this time.

    Boom! Again, I didn't give a shit.
